# Here are 10 common mistakes in English essay writing with examples:

- Grammatical errors - These include errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, "She has went to the store" instead of "She has gone to the store".

- Spelling mistakes - These can be simple typos or more serious errors, such as using "there" instead of "their" or "they're".

- Incorrect word usage - This happens when the wrong word is used, such as using "effect" instead of "affect" or "accept" instead of "except".

- Lack of clarity - This happens when the writer doesn't communicate their ideas clearly, leaving the reader unsure of what they're trying to say.

- Overuse of passive voice - This happens when the writer uses passive voice too frequently, making the writing sound dull and lifeless. For example, "The ball was thrown by the boy" instead of "The boy threw the ball".

- Using informal language - This happens when the writer uses slang or casual language in a formal essay. For example, using "cool" instead of "interesting" or "amazing".

- Lack of organization - This happens when the writer doesn't structure the essay properly, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points.

- **Plagiarism** - This happens when the writer copies someone else's work and presents it as their own, without giving proper credit. This can result in serious consequences, including failing the assignment or even being expelled from school.

- *Lack of evidence* - This happens when the writer doesn't provide enough evidence to support their arguments or claims.

- Using overly complex language - This happens when the writer uses long, convoluted sentences or overly complex language, making it difficult for the reader to understand what they're trying to say.

> Overall, it's important to proofread your writing carefully and ensure that you're communicating your ideas clearly and effectively.
